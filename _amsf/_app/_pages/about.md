## Knapsack

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

## The website

hosted on github using github-pages. Using [Almace Scaffolding]() which is a Jekyll framework but it's somehow incompatible with gh-pages even though (it's complicated) so a workaround to it is by displaying only the generated static pages so if you look at the repository, the codes are a bit jumbled up and messy and really is not good code refactoring but there's a price to pay for aesthetics.
