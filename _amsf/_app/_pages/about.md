## Knapsack



## The Author


## The website

hosted on github using github-pages. Using [Almace Scaffolding]() which is a Jekyll framework but it's somehow incompatible with gh-pages even though (it's complicated) so a workaround to it is by displaying only the generated static pages so if you look at the repository, the codes are a bit jumbled up and messy and really is not good code refactoring but there's a price to pay for aesthetics.
