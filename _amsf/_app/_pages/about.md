Nael's Knapsack is a repository for essays written by Naelah Nordin. Inspired by the 10th engineer who gasped after knowing that I do programming for a living, I wanted to show how simple programming can be without the mumbo jumbo of tech vernacular.

# Knapsack

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

# The Author

Naelah Nordin is a 24 year old ('93) software developer, graphic designer and aspiring writer. Graduted with a computer science bachelor degree from International Islamic University Malaysia in 2016, she packed her bags in the summer of 2017 and migrated to Tokyo where she currently works in Ruby on Rails and iOS mobile application development.

# The website

hosted on [github-pages](https://pages.github.com). Theme used is Curtana from [Almace Scaffolding](https://sparanoid.com/lab/amsf/) which is a Jekyll framework but it's somehow incompatible with gh-pages even though most blogs hosted on gh-pages use Jekyll as their blogging platform (it's complicated). A workaround to it is by displaying only the generated static pages so if you look at the repository, the codes are a bit jumbled up and messy and really not good code refactoring but there's a price to pay for aesthetics.
